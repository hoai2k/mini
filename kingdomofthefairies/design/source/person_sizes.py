"""Person size: one consistent size for every sprite of a character.

Each character has a reference sprite (standing) and a head box in it (art px,
per look: original and tinted art are painted separately). Every other sprite
of the character is measured against it by the head, searched over size,
rotation and mirroring, and checked by eye (BY_EYE overrides a measure the
template can't read). The result, per sprite:

    px  the character's standing height as painted in this sprite, art px
        (the reference figure's painted height x the head ratio)

so a scene draws any of a character's sprites at one person height H with
scale H / px (drawPerson in src/pose.js), and they all match. The prince and
the crew have their own audit (audit_sprites.py: WALK_FIT, POSE_FIT).

  python3 design/source/person_sizes.py           write src/person-size.js, design/person-sizes.md
  python3 design/source/person_sizes.py --check   fail if a measured sprite or a setting here changed
                                                  since they were written (a fingerprint; no re-measure)
