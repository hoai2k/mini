# Kingdom of the Fairies — images and production direction

The complete [film story](film-story.md) and [five-act design](acts.md) are the
primary briefs. Use the original 1903 film’s theatrical framing, hand-painted
sets, costume gestures, shells, coral, enchanted armour, tower and cloud
transformations. The default game does not use modern band imagery.

## Agent workflow for image batches

Keep full-resolution artwork on disk; use small previews in conversation.
Generating many images is supported, but accumulating generated images,
full-size inspections and repeated references in one conversation can exceed
the model request's image-content limit, even on a later text-only turn.

- **Save immediately.** Copy each completed original to its named delivery
  location before starting more work. Preserve its full resolution and
  transparency. Record the request id, file path, prompt, generation id,
  reference paths, review status and outstanding corrections in a manifest
  or progress note on disk. Do not print base64 image data into tool output.
- **Review previews first.** For composition and consistency checks, use a
  separate thumbnail (roughly 640–1024 pixels on its longest edge), or a
  compact contact sheet for a small group. Keep the originals untouched.
  Inspect one image at a time; load a larger preview or a detail crop only
  when a specific check needs it. These sizes are practical starting points,
  not guaranteed service limits.
- **Choose references per scene.** Attach only the character sheets and
  scenery needed for the current prompt. Prefer suitably sized reference
  copies that still show the necessary faces, costumes and props; use an
  original when fine detail requires it. Do not attach the entire cast or
  repeatedly bring every previous image into context.
- **Work in small batches.** Generate, save and review a few images before
  continuing. Avoid returning a large batch of full-size images together.
  If the generation tool already displays a result, do not display it again
  just to confirm its path. Follow the tool's required output format.
- **Checkpoint conversation context.** Update the progress note between
  batches, then compact the conversation when supported before its image
  history grows large. Keep ids, paths, decisions and remaining work in the
  summary rather than reattaching artwork. Smaller previews reduce new
  inputs; they do not remove full-size images already in the history.
- **Recover without regenerating.** If “The combined resolved image content
  is too large” blocks even text-only messages, stop retrying the same
  request. Compact if available, or resume with a short text handoff in a
  clean conversation that has access to the same workspace. Check saved
  files and metadata first, finish preparation and validation, and generate
  only missing or specifically rejected images. Preserve unfinished work.
  Splitting Git commits does not fix a model image-input limit.
- **Finish the delivery.** Verify file counts, dimensions, transparency,
  naming, gallery links and generated-document checks. Keep planning art
  separate from playable assets unless integration is requested. Commit
  according to the repository agreement; do not leave the only record of
  delivered images in conversation history.

## New delivered artwork

| Asset | Delivery | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fairy title | `assets/fairies-title.webp`; PNG original in `generated/fairies/title-original.png` | Default title and game index cover. Original logo remains query-only. |
| Full-journey concept sheet | `generated/fairies/story-sheet.webp`; PNG original in `generated/fairies/story-original.png` | Documentation reference spanning all twelve story groups. |
| Install icons | `icons/*.png`, fitted from new title art | Default home-screen installation; originals in `icons/legacy/`. |

See [delivery notes and prompts](generated/fairies/README.md). Generated concepts
are illustrative; the film and written continuity have priority. The whale panel was revised to show the prince’s party leaving its mouth;
Azurine remains captive until the burning-castle rescue.

## Existing film reference images

The [expanded-world gallery](references/expanded-world/index.html) includes the
betrothal court, rampart, chariot, armoury, prison vision, hooded witch, demons,
fairy gifts and sea-moat tower. Its captured source frames and prompts explain
which details are reconstructed. The new sheet adds the complete underwater,
whale, rescue and wedding progression to those earlier studies.

## Future production requests

| Group | Characters and props | Setting or transformation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Betrothal and curse | Bel-Azor, Azurine, Aurora, three gift-bearing fairies, hostile witch; ring, flower, crown, gold and cradle | Royal court; shell-shaped bed; trapdoor apparition |
| Abduction and vision | Bound Azurine, demons, winged chariot, torches, broom | Rampart, airborne procession, armoury-to-tower dissolve |
| Arming and crossing | Prince in protected armour, helmet and sword, fairy gesture, royal sailors | Galley departure, mechanical water storm and wreck |
| Undersea rescue | Water fairy, conch/dolphin carriage, octopus, revived party, fish and lobster mounts | Wreck, submarine caves, lobster palace, sea-flora-to-azure-grotto dissolve |
| Neptune and whale | Neptune, tritons, naiads, lobster guards, swallowed travelers | Shell throne, whale entrance, shore delivery |
| Coastal rescue | Aurora guiding, prince diving/swimming, demon fire-setters, carried Azurine, witch in barrel | Cave exit, cliff/sea gap, prison tower, burning stair collapse, whirlpool |
| Wedding | Royal family, couple, heralds, pages and crowning fairies | Palanquin procession, cloud dissolve, fairy colonnade |

These are future requests, not new assets promised by this pass. Avoid replacing
playable scenery or sprites until the corresponding story update is scoped.
[The film adaptation plan](film-adaptation.md) scopes them chapter by chapter;
its planning images (character sheets and scene concepts) are requested below,
and the production art for the film edition (F1–F4) after them.

<!-- FILM ASSETS START: generated by source/build_film_assets.py -->

## Production art for the film edition

Requested 11 October 2026: 388 game assets for following the film (see [the adaptation plan](film-adaptation.md)). Each prompt is complete; paste it as it stands and attach the references it names (the character sheets and scene concepts are in [references/film-planning/](references/film-planning/index.html)). Sizes are 2× game units, as for the existing art, and match the sprite each one replaces so it drops into place. Name each file by its id and drop it in [`../intake/`](../intake/README.md). The ids are listed as `requested` in `assets/manifest.json`; until each arrives the game draws an interim cut-out or stand-in.

Delivery: 376 of 388 assets generated and prepared. [Delivery notes](generated/film-production/README.md) retain native originals and generation records.

### F1. Prince Bel-Azor

The player, in every act. One set, all to the same scale, so the whole game switches from the sailor at once. Until they arrive the game uses a cut-out of the prince from his character sheet, moved as a toy-theatre puppet.

### F5. Crew variety and idle frames

Requested 11 October 2026 after the sprite audit. Two crew roles shared one sprite, so the deck and the grotto showed twins; the bosun makes four. The idle frames give the crew and the Water Fairy the old-film idle the original revellers have (two extra frames each, flicked between with the film tricks in src/animation.js). sailor-seated-plain is for the default (partial) edition, where the sailor rides the moon boat without his guitar. Until each arrives the game draws the still (or a mirrored stand-in for the bosun and the second sleeper).

### F6. The playable prologue

Requested 11 October 2026 for the prologue as a short playable scene (the owner chose this over the painted tableaux): the prince walks the betrothal court in his court dress, chases the chariot along the rampart, and takes up his arms in the armoury.

### F7. The witch, redrawn after the film

Requested 11 October 2026.

These replace the five witch sprites at the same sizes and anchors (delivered; the superseded spectre originals are kept in generated/film-production/progress/superseded-witch-spectre/).

> the witch exactly as she appears in Méliès's 1903 film (attach references/film-witch/witch-05m18s.jpg and witch-13m20s.jpg, frames from the film): an old crone played on stage, bent almost double at the waist, in one heavy, long, shaggy woollen hooded robe hand-tinted a deep sea-green teal, hanging in thick soft folds to the ground and pooling at her feet (whole cloth, not torn into rags or wisps), tied with a cord girdle with tassels; the hood is up but her face shows beneath it: pale, deeply wrinkled, hook-nosed, with wisps of straggling white hair; bare bony old hands (not claws); a plain, straight, long wooden walking staff. A living old woman, never a faceless spectre or a grim reaper. Standing bent over, leaning on her staff with one hand and raising the other in a curse, facing left. Flat painted toy-theatre cut-out seen square-on, gouache on card with a faint pale cut edge, in the manner of Georges Méliès' 1903 film Le Royaume des fées: early-1900s stencil-tinted colour (sepia-grey line and tone with translucent washes of plum #2a1424, rose pink #f3c6dc, magenta #e0127a, moon gold #d9b34a, coral red #c8321e, grotto teal #5f8c88 and azure #6f9fc8 laid slightly out of register); no lettering; no cast shadow; isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

#### `witch-cloud` — The witch on her storm cloud

A living old woman, never a faceless spectre or a grim reaper. Rising out of a churning black-and-magenta storm cloud that hides her feet, both arms raised and the staff held high, lightning at her fingers, facing right. Flat painted toy-theatre cut-out seen square-on, gouache on card with a faint pale cut edge, in the manner of Georges Méliès' 1903 film Le Royaume des fées: early-1900s stencil-tinted colour (sepia-grey line and tone with translucent washes of plum #2a1424, rose pink #f3c6dc, magenta #e0127a, moon gold #d9b34a, coral red #c8321e, grotto teal #5f8c88 and azure #6f9fc8 laid slightly out of register); no lettering; no cast shadow; isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

A living old woman, never a faceless spectre or a grim reaper. Crouched on a small churning black-and-magenta storm cloud crossing the sky toward the left, staff raised, lightning cracking from its tip. Flat painted toy-theatre cut-out seen square-on, gouache on card with a faint pale cut edge, in the manner of Georges Méliès' 1903 film Le Royaume des fées: early-1900s stencil-tinted colour (sepia-grey line and tone with translucent washes of plum #2a1424, rose pink #f3c6dc, magenta #e0127a, moon gold #d9b34a, coral red #c8321e, grotto teal #5f8c88 and azure #6f9fc8 laid slightly out of register); no lettering; no cast shadow; isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

A living old woman, never a faceless spectre or a grim reaper. Flying horizontally to the left as if hung on a wire across the stage, the heavy robe streaming back behind her, one bony hand reaching forward, the staff along her body. Flat painted toy-theatre cut-out seen square-on, gouache on card with a faint pale cut edge, in the manner of Georges Méliès' 1903 film Le Royaume des fées: early-1900s stencil-tinted colour (sepia-grey line and tone with translucent washes of plum #2a1424, rose pink #f3c6dc, magenta #e0127a, moon gold #d9b34a, coral red #c8321e, grotto teal #5f8c88 and azure #6f9fc8 laid slightly out of register); no lettering; no cast shadow; isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

A living old woman, never a faceless spectre or a grim reaper. Shut inside an old iron-hooped wooden barrel, only her hooded head, her furious wrinkled face and her two bony hands showing over the rim, gripping it. Flat painted toy-theatre cut-out seen square-on, gouache on card with a faint pale cut edge, in the manner of Georges Méliès' 1903 film Le Royaume des fées: early-1900s stencil-tinted colour (sepia-grey line and tone with translucent washes of plum #2a1424, rose pink #f3c6dc, magenta #e0127a, moon gold #d9b34a, coral red #c8321e, grotto teal #5f8c88 and azure #6f9fc8 laid slightly out of register); no lettering; no cast shadow; isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

### F8. Tinted alternates, after the film's look

Requested 11 October 2026 after the character audit (design/character-audit.md). The delivered cast are crisp storybook chromolithographs; the 1903 film is photographed stage performers, hand stencil-coloured. Each entry redraws an existing sprite in the film's look as a separate <id>-tinted file at the same size, pose, scale and anchor. They are the film edition's default cast look; Settings › Cast look › Original (or ?look=original) returns to the first art.

### F9. Tinted alternates, the rest of the film edition

Requested 12 October 2026 after the tinted cast arrived: the remaining figures, creatures and props the film edition draws (Neptune's court, the sea creatures, the whale, the gifts, keepsakes, armour and sword) are still in the clean first style beside the tinted cast. Same look and rules as F8: a separate <id>-tinted file at exactly the original's canvas, pose and placement. The tinted cast look draws them where delivered; the originals stay for the Original look and the other editions.

### F10. The prince's stride frames

Requested 12 October 2026 after play-testing: the delivered walk-a/walk-b pairs hardly move the legs, and the court-dress pair changes costume between frames (pink tights and a silver belt in A, grey tights and a green belt in B). The game flicks between two frames as he walks, so each pair must be two opposite strides of one identical figure. Until a pair arrives the game alternates walk-a with the standing pose. Each look has its own pair; draw the tinted ones over the tinted standing pose and the others over the original.

### F12. Walking passing poses

Requested 12 October 2026: complete every ground-walking cycle with contact A, passing A, contact B, passing B. Passing poses bring the legs together beneath the hips, with one support foot planted and the opposite knee bent as its foot swings through. They are moving poses, not standing stills. Keep costume, face, head scale and ground anchor consistent across the entire cycle. The sailor poses are shared by the partial and Widow’s Bay editions.

### F13. Walking while carrying

Requested 12 October 2026: carrying someone still requires a ground-walking cycle. These contact and passing frames keep the carried woman, the carrier’s arms and the hold unchanged while the legs move. Walking uses all four phases, including carrying on stairs; stationary carrying and airborne movement retain their own poses. The sailor set is shared by the partial and Widow’s Bay editions.

360 × 400 px, anchor bottom centre.

> Exactly the two figures and carrying hold in sailor-carry.webp (attach it). Keep both faces, costumes, colours, the carried woman’s pose and the supporting arms unchanged. The carrier walks RIGHT in the pass-b phase. Right support leg vertical beneath the hip; left knee bent and left foot lifted beside the support ankle.

### F14. Walking cycle repairs

Requested 13 October 2026 after checking the F10–F13 deliveries side by side. In the Original look, stride B of the armed prince and of the court-dress prince is a far longer lunge than stride A, so his head drops 24–26 px (of 360) on every other step and he limps; the tinted frames are even. The shared sailor carries his sack in the standing and new passing frames but not in the older walk-a/walk-b frames, so the sack blinked on and off with each step; until sailor-stride-a/b arrive the game holds each stride through its passing beat (a two-frame walk). The -redo frames replace prince-stride-b.webp and prince-court-stride-b.webp when delivered.

220 × 360 px, anchor bottom centre.

> Redraw prince-stride-b.webp (attach it with prince-stride-a.webp, prince-pass-a.webp and prince-stand.webp). Exactly the same figure, costume and colours, walking right, with the RIGHT leg forward, heel down, and the left leg behind on its toes; but the stride exactly as long as in prince-stride-a.webp (mirrored legs), so the top of the head sits within 6 px of where it is in stride A (about 5 px from the top of the canvas).

### F15. The gift fairies, empty-handed

Requested 13 October 2026 after play-testing the prologue. The three gift fairies hold their gifts painted into their own sprites, so when the prince receives a gift it stays in her hands. These alternates are the same fairies with the gift left out and the hands in the same pose. The game draws the delivered gift prop (gift-ring, gift-crown, gift-gold) in her hands until he takes it, then shows her empty-handed. The court backdrop holds no gifts and needs no change.

#### `fairy-ring-empty-tinted` — The fairy of the ring, empty-handed (tinted)

220 × 420 px, anchor bottom centre.

> Redraw fairy-ring-tinted.webp (attach it) exactly: the same fairy, gown, veil, hennin or crown, colours, scale, pose, framing, foot position and 220 x 420 canvas, so it lays over the original pixel for pixel. Only leave out the ring: her right hand still raised high, fingers curled as if holding a small ring up to the light, with nothing in them. Paint what the gift covered (sleeve, gown, veil) in the same style. No floor or shadow. Render it like a frame of a hand stencil-coloured 1903 Méliès print, not an illustration: a soft-focus black-and-white photograph of a real stage performer in costume (silvery greys, deep blacks, gentle film grain and a little halation), with only a few flat, translucent aniline dye washes laid over by stencil (sea-green teal, orange-yellow, rose and coral red, pale sky blue, magenta), each bleeding slightly past its edges and a little out of register, and large areas left untinted grey; a simple theatre costume of cloth, tights, wig and painted card props with little fine detail and no gold filigree; flat frontal stage lighting; no ink outlines and no glossy finish.

### F16. Tinted strides that bob

Requested 13 October 2026 after play-testing ?widowsbay=off: the prince bobbed as he walked. design/source/audit_sprites.py shows why: in the tinted look the head of each stride frame sits far below the passing frames (23 px of 360 in court dress, 14 px armed), where a real walk dips it about 9 px. Until these arrive the game scales those frames up from the feet to a natural dip (src/sprite-fit.js), which makes the body pulse slightly larger. Each -redo frame replaces its stride file on delivery; rerun the audit then.

Keep the stride shorter if needed rather than shrinking the figure: the head, shoulders and hands must be exactly the size they are in the passing frames. Feet on the bottom ground line; no floor or shadow.

### F17. The man-at-arms, unlike the prince

Requested 13 October 2026 after play-testing Act II: the man-at-arms carries the prince's own blue shield with the gold star, a plumed silver helmet and a red cape, so when he wakes on the cave floor and rises he looks like a second prince. Redraw him (and his idle frames) in his crew's livery with heraldry of his own. Each -redo frame replaces its file on delivery; until then Act II casts another crewman in his place.

> Redraw crew-manatarms-idle-b-tinted.webp (attach it, and prince-stand-tinted.webp to show what he must NOT resemble). The same man, pose, halberd, scale, foot position and 220 x 420 canvas, in the same striped crew livery as crew-squire-tinted.webp and crew-helmsman-tinted.webp. Change everything he shares with the prince: an open iron kettle-hat with no plume instead of the plumed silver helmet; a short cloak in the crew's green and ochre instead of the red cape; a red-and-ochre striped heater shield with no star, or no shield at all, instead of the blue star shield. No floor or shadow. Keep it an idle frame of the redrawn crew-manatarms-tinted-redo.webp: exactly the same figure, with only the detail that moved in crew-manatarms-idle-b-tinted.webp moving. Render it like a frame of a hand stencil-coloured 1903 Méliès print, not an illustration: a soft-focus black-and-white photograph of a real stage performer in costume (silvery greys, deep blacks, gentle film grain and a little halation), with only a few flat, translucent aniline dye washes laid over by stencil (sea-green teal, orange-yellow, rose and coral red, pale sky blue, magenta), each bleeding slightly past its edges and a little out of register, and large areas left untinted grey; a simple theatre costume of cloth, tights, wig and painted card props with little fine detail and no gold filigree; flat frontal stage lighting; no ink outlines and no glossy finish. Isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

### F18. The lobster guard, one look in both poses

Requested 13 October 2026 after play-testing Act III: in the tinted look the guard's two poses do not match. lobster-guard-open-tinted is a warm, shaded red with full sea-green weed; lobster-guard-closed-tinted is a flatter, pinker red with paler weed, so he flickers between two creatures as his claws open and shut. Redraw the shut pose to match the open one exactly. The -redo frame replaces lobster-guard-closed-tinted.webp on delivery.

#### `lobster-guard-closed-tinted-redo` — The lobster guard, claws shut (tinted), matched to the open pose

500 × 340 px, anchor bottom centre.

> Redraw lobster-guard-closed-tinted.webp (attach it, and lobster-guard-open-tinted.webp, which it must match). The same pose: crouched, the halberd held across the way, claws shut; the same canvas, scale and foot position. But exactly the colouring, shading, weed, shells and film finish of lobster-guard-open-tinted.webp: the same red of the shell, the same depth of shadow, the same sea-green and rose weed and pearl trim. Laid side by side the two must read as one guard in two poses. No floor or shadow. Render it like a frame of a hand stencil-coloured 1903 Méliès print, not an illustration: a soft-focus black-and-white photograph of a real stage performer in costume (silvery greys, deep blacks, gentle film grain and a little halation), with only a few flat, translucent aniline dye washes laid over by stencil (sea-green teal, orange-yellow, rose and coral red, pale sky blue, magenta), each bleeding slightly past its edges and a little out of register, and large areas left untinted grey; a simple theatre costume of cloth, tights, wig and painted card props with little fine detail and no gold filigree; flat frontal stage lighting; no ink outlines and no glossy finish. Isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

### F19. The continuous climb

Requested 14 October 2026 for the redesigned climbs of Act V (the cliff and the tower wall): he climbs anywhere on the painted face, faster up ivy and the cracks between blocks, slower over bare rock and under overhangs, walks the ledge tops, and hauls himself onto them. These back-view frames play at his climbing speed in any direction (the up cycle runs backwards to climb down; the traverse is mirrored to go left); the mantle frames carry him from the face onto a ledge (and, reversed, down off one). On the ledge tops he turns to profile and uses his walking and standing frames. Until they arrive the game draws prince-climb-a/b, prince-hang and prince-pullup.

> Prince Bel-Azor exactly as in references/film-planning/originals/char-bel-azor.png (attach it): silver plumed helmet with a magenta plume, silver cuirass with a gold star over an azure tunic with gold fleurs-de-lis, a crimson cloak, sword and round star shield, dark moustache and pointed beard. Moving sideways to the RIGHT across the wall: right arm stretched out to the right at shoulder height, right leg stepping out to the right, left hand and foot still where they were, so he is spread wide. First of four traversing frames (the game mirrors them for moving left). Seen from directly BEHIND, his back to us, flat against a vertical wall that is not drawn: we see the back of his plumed helmet, the crimson cloak hanging down his back (gathered so it does not hide his legs), the star shield slung across his back and the sword at his hip.

Isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

#### `prince-wall-hit` — Struck by a falling stone

360 × 440 px, anchor bottom centre (lowest boot).

> Prince Bel-Azor exactly as in references/film-planning/originals/char-bel-azor.png (attach it): silver plumed helmet with a magenta plume, silver cuirass with a gold star over an azure tunic with gold fleurs-de-lis, a crimson cloak, sword and round star shield, dark moustache and pointed beard. Struck by a falling stone while clinging: head ducked down between his shoulders, one hand torn off the wall and flung out, the other still gripping, one foot slipping loose below. A jolt, not a fall. Seen from directly BEHIND, his back to us, flat against a vertical wall that is not drawn: we see the back of his plumed helmet, the crimson cloak hanging down his back (gathered so it does not hide his legs), the star shield slung across his back and the sword at his hip. The same scale and proportions as every other prince- sprite (prince-stand: cap-of-helmet to chin is one ninth of a standing figure). Hands and boot-toes press on the unseen wall; nothing but the figure: no wall, rock, ivy or shadow. Match the other climbing frames of this set (attach prince-climb-a.webp and prince-stand.webp) in costume, colours and scale. Flat painted toy-theatre cut-out seen square-on, gouache on card with a faint pale cut edge, in the manner of Georges Méliès' 1903 film Le Royaume des fées: early-1900s stencil-tinted colour (sepia-grey line and tone with translucent washes of plum #2a1424, rose pink #f3c6dc, magenta #e0127a, moon gold #d9b34a, coral red #c8321e, grotto teal #5f8c88 and azure #6f9fc8 laid slightly out of register); no lettering; no cast shadow; isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

### F20. Poses the scenes need

Requested 14 October 2026 after auditing every board and scene of the film edition for poses its sprites don’t show. Until now the game turned, flipped or tipped an upright cut-out: the prince and crew crawl out of the whale as walking figures laid on their sides, the prince lies on the sea floor as his swimming frame upside down, the sinking crew and the swallowed prince are standing figures spun round, the cliff dive is his leap turned, the court-dress prince leaps the rampart fires as a tipped standing figure, and the crew wake by swinging up from the floor. Each entry notes where it plays. The game keeps its stand-ins until they arrive.

### F21. Each crewman asleep, at his own scale

Requested 16 October 2026 after play-testing Act II: a sleeper on the cave floor wakes, sits up and stands, but the two lying sprites (crew-asleep, crew-asleep-b) are a generic squire and a generic man-at-arms, so the bosun and the helmsman woke as someone else, and both are painted larger or smaller than the standing crew (the game corrects their size meanwhile). Each crewman now gets his own, painted at his standing scale so he stays the same man and the same size from lying to sitting up (crew-*-sit-up) to standing. Until they arrive the game draws the squire and the man-at-arms on the old sprites, size-corrected, and the bosun and the helmsman on the nearest of them.

### F22. Aurora gliding, and the prince struggling

Requested 30 October 2026 for the reworked armoury: the prince, bound by the witch, struggles left and right against her cords until Aurora glides on, breaks the spell, arms him and glides off. Until they arrive the game floats aurora-stand across the stage with a sparkle trail, and rocks prince-bound from side to side.

Isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

### F23. Azurine seized at the betrothal

Requested 30 October 2026: at the end of the betrothal court the witch curses Azurine, she swoons, and the witch and her two demons seize her and fly up and away with her. Until they arrive the game tips azurine-stand over into azurine-asleep, and lifts demon-red and demon-teal (drawn running) tilted beneath her.

Isolated on a transparent background (or flat pure magenta #FF00FF if transparency is unavailable).

## Planning images for the film adaptation

Delivery: 30 images generated for design review. [Browse the gallery](references/film-planning/index.html) or [read the delivery notes](references/film-planning/README.md). The original briefs below are retained. Character sheets guided scene generation; the images are not integrated into gameplay. Actual native dimensions are recorded in the manifest; the larger requested dimensions remain production targets.

Requested 11 October 2026 for [the film adaptation plan](film-adaptation.md): 10 canonical character sheets and 20 scene concepts. They are for agreeing the cast, the look and the staging before the art and code rounds, and are documentation art, not game files, so they are not in `assets/manifest.json`. Every prompt is complete; paste it as it stands. Generate the character sheets first and agree on them, then attach the relevant sheets as image references for each scene so the cast stays consistent. Where a prompt names a file under `references/expanded-world/`, attach that image too. Name each file by its id (for example `char-bel-azor.png`) and drop it in [`../intake/`](../intake/README.md); on integration they land in `references/film-planning/`.

#### `char-bel-azor` — Prince Bel-Azor

> Prince Bel-Azor (a mature, dignified prince with a dark moustache and short pointed beard, played in the film by Méliès himself) in the enchanted armour Aurora gives him: a silver plumed helmet, a silver cuirass over an azure tunic, a sword and a round shield with a star; one small extra figure of him in his court dress for the prologue. He is the player character, so his silhouette must read clearly at small size.

One full figure seen front-on, one in profile facing right and one three-quarter view, standing side by side at the same scale on a flat warm-grey card background, with two or three small detail sketches (face, hands, a key prop) along the bottom. Painted as a toy-theatre cut-out: gouache on card with a faint pale cut edge, no cast shadow.

#### `char-aurora` — The fairy Aurora

> the fairy Aurora (Azurine's fairy godmother: tall, luminous, in white and moon-gold gauze with a starred diadem and a star-tipped wand), raising her wand in the arming gesture.

## Preserved delivery catalogue

Historical production prompts and the original generated Part C are in
[legacy/image-requests.md](legacy/image-requests.md). The generator now maintains
that archived document; `--check` still verifies delivery consistency.
Band stills, idle frames, footage loops and song remain in the asset tree for
`?widowsbay`. `src/theme.js` excludes their slots before the default loader
fetches any of them. Other scenic assets stay shared.
