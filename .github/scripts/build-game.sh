# The command runs from the repository root with `bash -e`, exactly as the
# workflow step used to. If it fails, the game's live copy is published
# instead, so one broken game never stops the others:
#   1. rebuild the game from the commit that is live now (the head of the
#      last successful run of this workflow), which reproduces the live copy
#      exactly when the fault is in the new commit;
#   2. failing that, crawl the folder off the live site (fetch-live.py; it can
#      miss files the code names only at run time);
#   3. failing that, leave the folder out.
# Each failure is a workflow warning and a line in the job summary. A game
# that built is listed in $RUNNER_TEMP/built; check-games.sh fails the deploy
# only when none did.
