# The Ice-Cream Cone Coot

A field guide of rare birds from Arnold Lobel's *The Ice-Cream Cone Coot and
Other Rare Birds* (1971), with a Mario Party-style minigame for each bird:
catch scoops as the Ice-Cream Cone Coot, pour tea into the Cupadee, take
pictures as the Shuttercluck, and so on through all 28 of the book's birds. Each game lasts 30
to 60 seconds and keeps your best score ("New World Record!" when you beat
it, or "Personal Best!" while it's still short of opening the next page); reaching a set score opens the next page of the guide
and earns the bird's sticker for the sticker book. The book opens at a
painting of all the birds together, each bird's spot greyed until its
sticker is snapped into it (it melts in and the bird takes its colour; on a
phone the painting is zoomed in and scrolls); the stickers can also be put
anywhere on its pages, over that painting, a plain page or a picture of each
bird passed (its own book painting, IC-B01..B28, or its game's scene until
that arrives).

Play it at https://hoai2k.github.io/mini/icecreamcone/. It sits behind the
shared invite gate (`game/src/gate/gate.js`, a byte-identical copy of the one
in the `hoai2k.github.io` repository), which is off on localhost.

- [`design/design.md`](design/design.md): the flow, the guide, the sticker
  book, the controls and the first ten minigames; the other 18 are in
  [`design/more/`](design/more/).
- [`design/image-requests.md`](design/image-requests.md): the open image requests
  (finished ones move to [`design/image-requests-history.md`](design/image-requests-history.md)),
  generated from [`design/source/build_requests.py`](design/source/build_requests.py),
  which also writes `game/src/asset-list.js`. Edit the data there and rerun it.
  Delivered images live in [`game/assets/`](game/assets/); the request list tracks remaining work. The first
  25 images have prompts and checksums in
  [`design/image-deliveries.json`](design/image-deliveries.json); the 14
  gameplay sprites and the medal sheet (no longer used) are recorded with their grid layouts in
  [`design/image-deliveries-round-2.json`](design/image-deliveries-round-2.json).
  The expanded seaside for Scoop Stack is recorded in
  [`design/image-deliveries-wide.json`](design/image-deliveries-wide.json).
  The 18 additional book birds and 10 original pocket birds are recorded in
  [`design/image-deliveries-subjects.json`](design/image-deliveries-subjects.json).
  Backgrounds for the 18 additional minigames are recorded in
  [`design/image-deliveries-minigame-scenes.json`](design/image-deliveries-minigame-scenes.json).
  New image drops go in [`intake/`](intake/README.md).
- [`reference/`](reference/README.md): photos of the book's pages and notes on
  its style and its birds, for the image generator. Reference only; never
  published.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `game/src/main.js` | Screens, menus and navigation, the guide, bird pages, running a minigame (count-in, HUD, pause, results, best scores) |
| `game/src/reward.js` | After a round: celebration or brief result, the celebration's steps and timing, the sticker book's layout (two spreads of 14, or all the birds together on one spread with the sticker sheet) |
| `game/src/celebrate.js` | The sticker celebration and the sticker book screen, drawn on the stage: die-cut stickers from the portraits, the book and its pictures, the greyed spots of all the birds together and a sticker snapping into one, the flight, the hand |
| `game/src/stickerbook.js` | The sticker book's rules: where a dropped sticker goes, the pile's order, the pictures unlocked, what is saved (and loading older saves); on all the birds together, which spot a drop lands on (from `assets/book/gathering.atlas.json`), snapping in and out, and the zoomed view's scrolling |
| `game/src/birds.js` | The field guide's 28 birds in order: names, rhymes, goals, tips, the score that opens the next page (the first ten here) |
| `game/src/more/*.js` | The book's other 18 birds' guide entries (pages 11 to 28), with their controls; `more/index.js` puts them in order |
| `game/src/subjects.js` | The birds Shuttercluck can photograph (the 18 above and ten of our own): names, rarity, their stand-in drawings and where each painting goes; a round uses our ten and whichever of the 18 are still locked |
| `game/src/games/*.js` | One minigame per bird; `games/index.js` documents the contract they share |
| `game/src/draw.js` | Ink-and-wash drawing: the stand-in birds, how each delivered portrait is placed, and what is drawn over it (lamps, growth, blinks) |
| `game/src/input.js` | Controllers, keyboard, mouse and touch, as one small set of actions |
| `game/src/audio.js` | Synthesised sound effects and music-box tunes |
| `game/src/store.js` | Saved settings, best scores and the sticker book (`icecreamcone.stickers.v1`) |
| `game/assets/*/gathering.atlas.json` | Where each bird is in the two gathering paintings (the book's 2:1 one and the finale's 16:9 one) |

                                   # the spreads; pictures; kept over a reload), the gathering zoomed
                                   # and scrolling on phones (390x844, 844x390), then all 28
                                   # minigames to their end (--no-games skips those)
python3 ../design/source/build_requests.py --check
```

`publish.sh` copies the game into the Pages output (`local/pages/icecreamcone`).
The browser check simulates an Xbox controller by replacing
`navigator.getGamepads` and runs with `?dt=0.05`. Testing with a real Xbox
controller, and listening to the synthesised sound, are still outstanding.
