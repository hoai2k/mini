STYLE = (
    "Original artwork in the style of Hanneke de Neve, a Dutch-born New Jersey artist who "
    "makes fibercollages, quilts, tapestries and paintings: figurative and dreamlike, built "
    "from cut and pieced fabric and loose paint. Flat shapes cut from cloth with slightly "
    "irregular, softly frayed edges; visible hand stitching (running stitch, couched thread, "
    "machine zigzag); batik, paisley, damask, satin, lace and netting side by side; figures "
    "and faces with oval heads, long necks and almond eyes, often closed, drawn in one fluid "
    "dark contour over washes of colour that spill past the line. Deep indigo, black and teal "
    "grounds with hot accents of red, orange, saffron and pale gold, and acid yellow-green "
    "light. Calm, warm, a little melancholy, full of love for people. Rich, saturated colour, "
    "as in a fresh photograph of the real cloth, not faded. No text, no lettering, no "
    "signature, no watermark, no picture frame, no UI."
)

LOOK = "For the style, materials and palette, look at her work in these reference photos: {0} ."

ALPHA = (
    "Transparent background (PNG with alpha). If transparency is not possible, use a flat pure "
    "magenta #FF00FF background with nothing else on it and no cast shadow; it is keyed out on "
    "integration."
)

COMPOSITION = (
    "A complete picture in landscape 16:9, full bleed, meant both as a finished artwork and as "
    "the key a game scene is built from: every motif named below will later be cut out and "
    "moved on its own, so give each one a clear, readable silhouette, keep the motifs apart "
    "from each other (touching at most at an edge, never overlapping much), and make each "
    "one a distinct piece of cloth or paint against the ground. "
)

GROUND = (
    "The same picture as the attached composition, request {0} (file {1}), at exactly the same "
    "framing and scale, but with these motifs taken out: {2}. Where each one was, continue "
    "the ground underneath as if it had never been there (the sky, the field, the patchwork, "
    "the stitching running on), with no gap, hole, outline or ghost of the removed shape. "
    "Everything else stays exactly as it is in the composition. Full bleed 16:9, opaque. "
)

PIECES = (
    "A sheet of separate cut-out pieces for a game that moves, stretches, turns and dissolves "
    "each one on its own. Draw each motif below exactly as it appears in the attached "
    "composition, request {0} (file {1}): same design, colours, materials, stitching and "
    "scale relative to each other, in the same orientation it has there (do not turn it to fit "
    "the cell). Each piece is complete and whole, including any part that was hidden behind "
    "another motif, with its own frayed or painted edge all round and a little of its "
    "stitching or thread running loose past the edge. "
)

GRID = (
    "Lay them out in a grid of {0} columns and {1} rows, in the order listed, from left to right "
    "and top to bottom, one per cell and centred in it, with plenty of clear background around "
    "each one. Nothing touches anything else or the edge of its cell. No numbers, labels, guide "
    "lines, outlines around the cells or shadows. "
)

CHAIN = (
    "A morph chain: one motif changing step by step into others, for a game that blends each "
    "stage into the next. {0} stages in one row from left to right, all at the same size and "
    "centred on the same point in their cells, each about as wide and tall as the others so "
    "one can grow out of the last. Each stage is a finished cut-cloth motif with stitched "
    "edges, and each shares something with its neighbours (the curve of an edge, a colour, a "
    "line of stitches, the closed eyes) so the change feels grown rather than swapped. The "
    "stages, in order: {1}. Even spacing, plenty of clear background between them, nothing "
    "touching. No numbers, arrows or labels. "
)

TILE = (
    "A seamlessly tiling square texture of one fabric, photographed flat and straight on in "
    "even, soft light, filling the whole square with no edge, fold, shadow or vignette: it must "
    "repeat in both directions with no visible seam. The fabric: {0}. Rich, saturated colour; "
    "the weave and thread visible up close. No motifs that read as a picture on their own. "
)

MASK = (
    "A greyscale dissolve map for a game shader, square, opaque, no colour at all: pure white "
    "is where an image disappears first and pure black where it disappears last, with every "
    "shade of grey between, so that as a threshold sweeps from white to black the image wears "
    "away in this way: {0}. Use the full range from pure white to pure black, with smooth "
    "gradients inside the shapes and fine, crisp detail along their edges. Nothing else in "
    "the image, no texture of paper or cloth, no text. "
)
