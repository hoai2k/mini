# Fibre Art

A shifting collage after the work of Hanneke de Neve, a Dutch-born artist in
New Jersey and a friend of the repository owner. Published at
https://hoai2k.github.io/mini/fibreart/.

Each scene is one of her pictures rebuilt as a live patchwork: a ground cut
into panels, with pieces of cloth laid on it. Every stick, trigger and button
is tied to something in the picture, some to a single moon or face, a few to
the whole picture. Small moves set up the large ones: a large control is
centred on one piece, and its reach grows as that piece is brought to the
middle, sewn to others or brought to its partner. Large effects rearrange the
picture or carry it into the next scene, and the controls are dealt again.
Nothing to win or lose; left alone, the pieces drift home. The pictures are
never quite still: wind gusts bend the trees and blow leaves across, and the
people breathe and tilt their heads. One to four controllers, plus keyboard and mouse.

## Layout

- [`game/`](game/): the game, static ES modules with no build step.
  - `index.html`, `styles.css`; `src/main.js` (shell, menus, players, pointer),
    `src/collage.js` (the rules: pieces, panels, bindings, verbs, setups, scene
    changes; no DOM, tested in Node), `src/render.js` (WebGL2: pieces as
    bendable meshes, one shared swirl/tide/ripple field, mask dissolves),
    `src/life.js` (wind, gusts, blowing leaves, breathing, blinking: the
    pictures' small life), `src/overlay.js` (stitched outlines, threads, pinned drawings),
    `src/input.js` (one player per controller, keyboard as another),
    `src/audio.js` (sound made in the browser).
  - `web/`: the optimised art the game loads and `web/scenes.json` (every
    scene's pieces, their homes in the composition, kinds and morph chains),
    written by [`tools/build_web.py`](tools/build_web.py) from `assets/`.
  - `assets/`: the full-size delivered images (not published); see
    [`game/assets/README.md`](game/assets/README.md).
  - `test/`: Node tests of the rules; `scripts/browser-check.mjs`: a Playwright
    run with a simulated Xbox controller that plays every scene.
- [`design/design.md`](design/design.md): the scenes, layers, verbs and how
  the controls work, and what playing it with the delivered art showed.
- [`design/image-requests.md`](design/image-requests.md): the image requests,
  generated from [`design/source/build_requests.py`](design/source/build_requests.py)
  (which also writes `design/asset-list.json`). Edit the data there and rerun it.
  [Image preview](design/generated-preview.jpg), [piece preview](design/pieces-preview.jpg),
  [delivery records](design/image-deliveries.json).
- [`reference/`](reference/README.md): photos of 28 of her works, a catalogue
  with sources, her statement, palettes and style notes. Reference only.
- [`tools/`](tools/): `extract_pieces.py` cuts the delivered piece sheets;
  `build_web.py` makes `game/web/` (Pillow, NumPy, SciPy).
- [`intake/`](intake/README.md): the drop box for new images and photos.

Stand-ins until the retried requests arrive: the Moons and hearts and The
dancers pieces are cut by colour from their compositions, the Viriditas ground
is a blurred wash of its composition, the icon is the moon chain's crescent on
indigo batik, and there is no tree or bird morph chain yet.

## Run and check

Serve `fibreart/game/` with any static server and open it, for example
`python3 -m http.server -d fibreart/game 8000`.

```sh
node --test fibreart/game/test/*.test.mjs
python3 fibreart/design/source/build_requests.py --check
python3 fibreart/tools/build_web.py --check      # after changing art or piece homes, rerun without --check
(cd fibreart/game && node scripts/browser-check.mjs --shots /tmp/fibreart-shots)
fibreart/publish.sh local/pages/fibreart
```

Browsers: current Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari with WebGL 2. Controller
play was checked with a simulated Xbox controller in Chromium; testing with a
real controller is still outstanding.
