# Music Practice

A metronome and a practice recorder. Open it at
https://hoai2k.github.io/mini/musicpractice/.

Made for phones (portrait or landscape) and desktops. The home screen has just
two buttons, **Metronome** and **Playback Recorder**, and a settings gear.

## Themes

The gear on the home screen opens the app's own settings, which for now hold
only **Theme**: a tile per theme, each drawn in its own colours and fonts (all
themes' fonts load only when this opens). Theme is also a dropdown at the
bottom of the metronome's and the Playback Recorder's settings. It switches
the whole app's look:

- **Classic** (the default): warm walnut and brass with Fraunces and Manrope.
- **Art Deco**: black lacquer, gold and ivory, Poiret One and
  Josefin Sans capitals, double gold frames, a sunburst background and fan,
  diamond beat markers and sliders, stepped hexagon buttons.
- **Vintage 60s**: cream, mustard, orange and teal in Righteous and Nunito,
  three bold stripes across the top with the back button, title and gear
  sitting on them as outlined cream badges, polka dots, rounded cards with
  offset print shadows.
- **18th Century**: parchment, sepia and burgundy with gilt, IM Fell English
  and EB Garamond in small capitals, double gilt frames and a fleuron rule.
- **Robot Future**: deep navy with cyan and magenta light, Orbitron and
  Exo 2, a HUD grid, chamfered panels and neon glow.
- **French Nouveau**: sage, cream, gold and rose, Italiana and Cormorant
  Garamond, asymmetric organic curves and a whiplash ornament.
- **Candy**: candy pink and sky blue on white in M PLUS Rounded, bold
  outlines, hard manga-panel shadows, halftone dots and sparkles.
- **Steam Punk**: dark leather with brass and copper, Cinzel and Special
  Elite, riveted plates and a gear.

Theme ids stay fixed when a theme is renamed (Robot Future is `scifi`,
Candy is `anime`), so saved choices and image paths keep working.
Each theme loads only its own fonts. All eight themes have delivered images.
The drawings in `app/src/standins.js` remain as loading and error fallbacks;
the newer themes share one drawing (`themed`), varied by case shape, palette
and pendulum weight.

A theme is three things: a `THEMES` entry in `app/src/settings.js` with its
fonts (the early script in `index.html` lists the ids too; a test checks they
match), its colours, type and
shapes in `app/styles.css` (`[data-theme="…"]`), and its images. Every image
belongs to a theme in `design/source/build_requests.py`. The app shows the
theme's delivered image or, until it arrives, that theme's drawn stand-in
(`app/src/standins.js`).

**Anchors:** the metronome is two layers. The body records its canvas size
and `pivot`; the pendulum records its canvas, `hub` and `swing` (degrees
each way); a pendulum can also give a `scale`. `pendulumLayout` in
`app/src/art.js` puts the hub on the pivot using whichever layers are
showing, delivered or stand-in, so each theme's art can put them anywhere.
The Classic art's measured anchors are pivot (400, 985) and hub (102, 927);
when the Art Deco art arrives, measure and record its own.

## Metronome

- A metronome with a swinging pendulum: it reaches one end of its swing on
  each click and the other end on the next, synced to what you hear
  (`pendulumAngle` in `app/src/metronome.js`, corrected for output latency).
  Dots under it show the beat of the bar.
- Tempo from 40 to 500 BPM: a slider, a number box (type any tempo; values
  outside the range are pulled in), and − / + buttons (hold to run). The
  Italian marking (Largo … Prestissimo) shows under the number. Default 120.
- Settings (gear): time signature (4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 3/8, 5/8,
  6/8, 7/8, 9/8, 12/8, or no bars), a strong beat on 1 (on by default;
  compound meters also lean lightly on each group of three), sound
  (Woodblock, Click, Beep) and volume.
- Sounds are synthesized with Web Audio and scheduled 120 ms ahead from a
  worker, so the beat stays steady when the page is busy, and keeps going if
  you switch to another tab (it's a practice tool; a hidden-tab mute would
  stop your metronome). The screen is kept awake while it runs.

## Playback Recorder

Opening it turns on the microphone and starts listening.

1. **Listening:** waits for you to play. A take starts on a held, clearly
   pitched note (about 130 ms of one steady pitch, louder than the room).
   Noises like moving a chair, knocking the desk or hiss have no steady
   pitch, so they don't start one. Two seconds of pre-roll are kept, so the
   first note is never cut off. (Settings → *Start recording on: Any sound*
   is for drums.)
2. **Recording:** keeps going until you've stopped playing for 3 seconds
   (Settings: 1–10 s). Soft, decaying notes still count as playing.
3. The take is **trimmed** (from just before the first note's attack to
   when the last note has rung down) and **played back**, with its waveform
   and a playhead. Then it listens again.

By default the microphone is **closed while a take plays** (from the list
too) and reopened when playback ends, so the app never plays and records at
once. An open mic puts phones, iPhone especially, into a quieter
play-and-record mode; closing it lets playback run at full volume.
Settings → **Record during playback** keeps the mic open instead: automatic
playback keeps listening, and starting to play over a take stops it and
begins the next one. That mode turns on the browser's echo cancellation so
the take being played isn't heard as playing; headphones work best, and on
iPhone playback is quieter.

Every take goes in the list under the waveform, saved in the browser
(IndexedDB) so it's still there next time. Each has a play/stop button and a
trash button (with a few seconds to Undo). While you use the list, listening
is paused; it resumes when playback ends or the Undo goes away. The big
record button turns listening on and off at any time; turning it off during
a take keeps the take.

Settings (gear): silence to finish, start on musical notes or any sound,
sensitivity (lower it in a noisy room, raise it for quiet instruments), and
whether to play each take back automatically, and record during playback
(off by default). All settings are kept in
`localStorage`.

How the detector works (`app/src/detect.js`): each 2048-sample frame is
measured for loudness and pitch clarity (the peak of McLeod's normalized
square difference function, near 1 for a musical tone, low for noise). The
room's noise floor is tracked while waiting (falls quickly, rises slowly).
Talking and singing are pitched, so they can start a take.

## Controls

Touch or mouse throughout. Keyboard: `Space` starts/stops the metronome or
turns listening on/off, arrow keys change the tempo (`Shift` for 10),
`Esc` goes back or closes settings. As a tool on the mini apps shelf it skips
the game title screen and controller support from `GAME_GUIDELINES.md` in
favour of the two-button home screen.

## Files

- `app/index.html`, `app/styles.css`, `app/src/`: the app (static ES
  modules, no build step). `main.js` the screens, `metronome.js` the
  scheduler, sounds and pendulum, `recorder.js` the mic and take state
  machine, `capture-worklet.js` the mic tap, `detect.js` the music/noise
  detector and trimming, `waveform.js` the waveform views, `takes.js` saved
  takes, `settings.js` settings and themes, `audio.js` the shared
  AudioContext, `art.js` theme art and pendulum anchors, `standins.js` each
  theme's drawn stand-ins.
- `design/image-requests.md` and `app/data/asset-list.json`: generated by
  `design/source/build_requests.py`. Round 1 (the Classic theme, the app
  icon and the library cover) is delivered; prompts, files and export
  details are in `design/image-deliveries.json`. The four Round 2 Art Deco
  theme images are delivered; their prompts, files and measured anchors are
  in `design/image-deliveries-round-2.json`. Round 3 delivers 24 images across
  Vintage 60s, 18th Century, Robot Future, French Nouveau, Candy and Steam
  Punk; prompts, paths and layer geometry are in `design/image-deliveries-round-3.json`.
- `design/source/make_icons.py`: makes `app/icons/icon-180/192/512.png`
  from the delivered `icon-1024.png`, or a drawn stand-in until then.
- `publish.sh`: copies the app to `local/pages/musicpractice/`.

## Checks

```sh
node --test musicpractice/app/test/*.test.mjs
python3 musicpractice/design/source/build_requests.py --check
musicpractice/publish.sh local/pages/musicpractice
```

The detector tests synthesize notes, chords, vibrato, hiss, chair scrapes and
thumps and check which start a take, when it ends and how it is trimmed. The
whole flow was also checked in Chromium with a synthesized session as the
microphone (a scrape, then a phrase, then silence): the scrape was ignored,
the take started on the first note, ended 3 s after the last, was trimmed to
the phrase, played back, and listening resumed. A second run, with a
second phrase starting during playback, checked both modes. By default the
mic was closed during playback (the second phrase was ignored) and reopened
afterwards. With Record during playback on, the mic stayed open and the
second phrase stopped the playback and started a new take.

## Leaving the app and coming back

Phones suspend sound, pause media and cut the mic while the app is in the
background. On return (`visibilitychange` in `app/src/main.js`):

- the AudioContext is resumed, so a metronome left running carries on (or
  on the next tap, if the browser wants one); the next Start gets a fresh
  context in case the output changed while away;
- a take that was playing back carries on from where it was paused, then
  listening resumes as usual;
- a mic that was cut off is reopened (`Recorder.reopen`). A take that was
  being recorded is kept as far as it got (without playback) and listening
  starts again. A watchdog also reopens the mic if it goes quiet for 2.5 s
  while the sound is running, and the same happens if a call takes the mic
  while the app is open (if it can't be reopened, the recorder turns off and
  says why).

Stopping the metronome or turning the recorder off before leaving, then
starting again after coming back, works as on a first visit. All of this was
checked in Chromium by simulating a phone leaving and returning (the page
hidden, the context suspended, the mic track ended, media paused): a running
metronome, a stopped one restarted, listening, recording mid-take, a take
playing back, the recorder turned off and on again, and a take playing from
the list.

## Known limits

- The microphone needs https (GitHub Pages is) and permission.
- **The mic is asked for once.** Asking again can bring the permission
  prompt back (Safari and every iPhone browser ask again unless the site is
  set to Allow), so once granted the mic is held for the whole visit: turning
  listening off, playing a take back and the metronome only stop processing
  it and switch its track off. It is asked for again only when the browser
  reports the held mic dead (the app was left, a call took it); a mic that
  merely goes quiet is reconnected without asking. The key loop (listen →
  record → play back → listen) never asks; checked in Chromium for 40 s of
  untouched use (3 takes, 1 request) and with permission saved or not.
- **Bluetooth speakers.** While a page holds the mic, phones stay in call
  mode, so sound goes to the phone's own speaker (or a Bluetooth headset's
  low-quality call mode) and is quieter. Since the mic is never released on
  purpose, this holds after the recorder has been used. Takes play through an
  `<audio>` element (primed by the first tap; Web Audio if it is refused),
  which follows the current output more reliably, and Safari's session is
  set to `playback` only while no mic is held. The metronome's Start replaces
  an AudioContext started while the mic was open or before an output change
  (`freshAudio` in `app/src/audio.js`). With Record during playback on, echo
  cancellation is used.
- If the browser stops remembering microphone permission, reopening the mic
  after each playback could ask again; turn on Record during playback to
  keep it open.

The browser favicon uses the conventional walnut metronome on a transparent
background (`icons/favicon-metronome-32.png` and `favicon-metronome-192.png`).
The Art Deco versions are kept as `favicon-art-deco-32.png` and
`favicon-art-deco-192.png` for a later switch; `make_icons.py` exports both.
