# Bronze Drum: sound effects

Every sound effect in the game, generated with ElevenLabs' sound-effects model from the prompts below. Generated from `source/build_audio.py`; edit the data there. `build_audio.py --generate` makes any effect whose file is missing, and `--force <id>` remakes one. The key is read from `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (or `~/.config/elevenlabs.key`) and never stored in the repository.

Processing: hits are trimmed so the sound starts on its transient (the drum strokes must land exactly when the player presses), one-shots get a short fade-out, every file is peak-normalised to -1 dBFS, and the game balances them with the per-sound gain. Effects with several variants are picked at random so repeated strokes do not sound mechanical.

Sound direction: real, acoustic and close — bronze, wood, bamboo, water, paper, voices. No synth tones, no music in the effects. Hits are paper tearing, never gore.

**69 of 71 files in use.**

Each generated file was checked by measuring its length, peak, level over time (50 ms windows) and the balance of energy below 200 Hz and above 2 kHz: a drum stroke must start on its loudest moment and be one stroke, a rim click must be bright and short. Takes that failed are kept out of the game:

- `sfx/kit-bamboo-high-1.mp3`: two takes, both with a second bounce of the beater; the other take, trimmed, is clean.
- `sfx/drum-tung-2.mp3`: eight takes, none both a single stroke and deep (more energy under 200 Hz than over 2 kHz); the model drifts to a bright metallic hit, and two good deep strokes give enough variety.

| `amb-garden` | Chapter 1 bed, looped.
