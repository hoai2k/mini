# Bronze Drum: music requests

Prompts for the score, ready to paste into a music generator (Suno, Udio, ElevenLabs Music or similar). Generated from `source/build_audio.py`; edit the data there and rerun it.

## How to use this list

- **Each prompt is complete on its own.** Paste the prompt as it stands; nothing needs combining. The style tags are a short version for generators with a separate style field, and are optional.
- Save each finished track as `bronzedrum/game/assets/music/<id>.mp3` (or drop it in `bronzedrum/intake/`). The game plays a track as soon as its file is there.
- Tracks marked *loops* must loop seamlessly: trim any silence at the start and end. The beds must stay beatless; if a generator adds a beat, regenerate.

## Why most of the music has no beat

Bronze Drum is a rhythm game: the player drums at any speed they like (about 45 to 200 BPM) and the army's drums answer at that speed. A second, fixed beat under the drumming would fight it, so the music that plays during a chapter is beatless: free time, no pulse, no percussion keeping time. Themes with melody and metre play only where nobody is drumming: on the title, the chapter select, the results and the ending.

**When each kind plays**

- **Themes:** the title screen and the chapter select.
- **Beds:** under each chapter, quietly, beneath the ambience.
- **Swell:** once over the bed when the drum wakes.
- **Stings and the ending:** on the results screens.
- **Song:** trailer and credits.

## What to make first

**Core (needed now):** `mu-title`, `mu-select`, `mu-bed-battle`, `mu-bed-story`, `mu-ending`. These five cover every screen: the two themes on the menus, the battle bed under every battle, the story bed under every story chapter, and the ending under the epilogue and the final screen.

**Maybe:** `mu-bed-oath` (its own bed for the funeral, instead of the story bed).

**Optional, for later:** everything else. A chapter's own bed replaces the shared bed when it is delivered; without the swell and the stings the game uses its sound effects (the waking drum and the cheer, the victory and defeat gongs).

## mu-title · Trống Đồng (title theme)

Title screen, looping.

- **Priority:** core · **Kind:** theme · **Length:** about 90 s · **Loops:** yes
- **File:** `bronzedrum/game/assets/music/mu-title.mp3`
- **Style tags (optional):** `vietnamese quan ho, sao truc flute, dan tranh zither, bronze gong, female voice, soft cinematic strings, 72 bpm, folk theme`

**Prompt:**

> A slow, proud and tender title theme for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre. Traditional northern Vietnamese style rooted in quan họ folk song from Bắc Ninh: a bamboo flute (sáo trúc) states the main melody in D minor pentatonic over rippling 16-string zither (đàn tranh) arpeggios; a soft bronze gong marks each phrase; halfway through a solo woman's voice sings the melody back on wordless vocables (à ơi) in quan họ manner; a quiet bed of modern cinematic strings swells underneath without taking over. 72 BPM in 4/4. About 90 seconds, built to loop: the last bar leads back into the first, no fade-out. No lyrics. Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.

## mu-select · Two Sisters (chapter select)

Chapter-select screen, looping.

- **Priority:** core · **Kind:** theme · **Length:** about 90 s · **Loops:** yes
- **File:** `bronzedrum/game/assets/music/mu-select.mp3`
- **Style tags (optional):** `vietnamese folk duet, dan tranh and sao truc, two intertwining themes, gentle, light ambient pad, 66 bpm`

**Prompt:**

> A tender theme about two sisters for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre. Traditional Vietnamese folk duet: the elder sister's theme on the 16-string zither (đàn tranh) is steady, dignified and on the beat; the younger sister's theme on the bamboo flute (sáo trúc) is quick, playful and bends around the beat; they take turns, tease each other, then play together in harmony in C major pentatonic. A light modern ambient pad gives warmth underneath. 66 BPM, gentle and a little bittersweet. About 90 seconds, built to loop seamlessly with no fade-out. No percussion, no lyrics. Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.

## mu-bed-battle · Battle bed (all battles)

Under every battle chapter (the Garden, the Outpost, Luy Lâu, Mã Viện Returns) unless that chapter has its own bed.

- **Priority:** core · **Kind:** bed · **Length:** about 2 min · **Loops:** yes
- **File:** `bronzedrum/game/assets/music/mu-bed-battle.mp3`
- **Style tags (optional):** `beatless vietnamese tense heroic ambient, dan nhi, dan nguyet tremolo, quan ho low choir, bronze gongs, cinematic drone, no drums`

**Prompt:**

> A tense, heroic, completely beatless background score for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre. It plays under battles while the player drums commands at any speed, so it must have no pulse, no metre and no drums or percussion keeping time. Traditional northern Vietnamese colour: a two-string fiddle (đàn nhị) plays long, resolute phrases in D minor pentatonic; a moon lute (đàn nguyệt) shivers in unmeasured tremolo; a low women's choir holds long notes in the manner of quan họ; large bronze gongs are struck softly now and then and left to ring, never in a pattern; the bamboo flute (sáo trúc) recalls a proud folk melody in fragments. Underneath, a deep modern cinematic drone and low strings rise and fall like wind over a river. Urgent and brave but never rhythmic. About 2 minutes, looping seamlessly: end where it began, with no fade-out and no silence at either end. No lyrics. Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.

## mu-bed-story · Story bed (all story chapters)

- **Priority:** core · **Kind:** bed · **Length:** about 2 min · **Loops:** yes
- **File:** `bronzedrum/game/assets/music/mu-bed-story.mp3`
- **Style tags (optional):** `beatless vietnamese reflective ambient, two sao truc flutes, dan bau hat ru, dan tranh harmonics, quan ho humming, warm pad`

**Prompt:**

> A warm, reflective, completely beatless background score for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre. It plays under quiet story chapters (a funeral, a bronze foundry, villages answering along a river at night, a coronation festival) while drummers call rhythms and the player answers at any speed, so it must have no pulse, no metre and no percussion keeping time. Traditional Vietnamese colour: one bamboo flute (sáo trúc) calls a short free-time phrase and a second, nearer flute answers; the monochord (đàn bầu) sings slow bending lines in the manner of a hát ru lullaby; 16-string zither (đàn tranh) harmonics glint like lantern light; now and then a woman's voice hums a phrase in the quan họ style; a soft bronze bell rings rarely and is left to decay. A gentle modern ambient pad gives warmth underneath. G major pentatonic, tender and hopeful with a thread of sadness. About 2 minutes, looping seamlessly: end where it began, with no fade-out and no silence at either end. No lyrics. Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.

**Prompt:**

> A sparse, mournful ending piece for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre. It plays as the bronze drums of the uprising are gathered to be melted down, and through the final screen. The monochord (đàn bầu) plays alone at first, bending each note like a voice holding back tears; two women's voices enter in the quan họ call-and-response style with a touch of ca trù ornament, singing a lament on wordless vocables (à ơi); a faint modern string pad joins near the end; finally a single bronze bell is struck and left to ring into silence. Entirely free and rubato, with no beat, no percussion and no steady tempo, so slow drumming can sit on top. A minor pentatonic. About 3 minutes. It should feel like dawn on a river after a loss. Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.

> A sparse, grieving beatless bed for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre, for the funeral of the sisters' father. Traditional northern Vietnamese mourning colour: the monochord (đàn bầu) bends slow lamenting phrases in A minor pentatonic over a low drone; now and then a woman's voice in the restrained, ornamented manner of ca trù hums a few notes; a soft bronze bell rings rarely and is left to decay; a faint modern low string pad sits underneath. Very quiet, lots of space for a slow mourning drum on top. Completely beatless and in free time: no pulse, no metre, no drums or percussion keeping time, so a player can drum on top at any speed. It must loop seamlessly: end where it began, with no fade-out and no silence at either end. About 2 minutes. No words. Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.

> A warm, hopeful beatless ambient bed for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre, for the sisters' training in their father's garden at dawn. Traditional Vietnamese colour: a bamboo flute (sáo trúc) plays short free-time phrases in G major pentatonic like birdsong, 16-string zither (đàn tranh) harmonics shimmer and fade, a low warm modern synth pad holds a slowly changing chord. Morning light, green and gold, unhurried. Completely beatless and in free time: no pulse, no metre, no drums or percussion keeping time, so a player can drum on top at any speed. It must loop seamlessly: end where it began, with no fade-out and no silence at either end. About 2 minutes. No lyrics. Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.

> A warm, glowing beatless bed for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre, for a night in an ancient bronze foundry where the war drums are cast. Traditional Vietnamese colour: men's and women's voices hum a free-time work song in the manner of hò, long notes rising and falling; a moon lute (đàn nguyệt) adds soft tremolo phrases; struck bronze bars and bowls ring and are left to resonate; a deep modern drone like the furnace's breath holds it together. Orange and bronze, patient and strong. Completely beatless and in free time: no pulse, no metre, no drums or percussion keeping time, so a player can drum on top at any speed. It must loop seamlessly: end where it began, with no fade-out and no silence at either end. About 2 minutes. No lyrics.

> A hopeful night-time beatless bed for a video game about the Trưng sisters, who led an army of women in an uprising against Han rule in ancient Vietnam around 40 CE, staged as a backlit paper-cut theatre, for villages along the Red River answering the sisters' call one by one. Traditional Vietnamese colour: one bamboo flute (sáo trúc) calls a short phrase from far away and a second, nearer flute answers, again and again; between them a man's voice drifts a line of a river boat song (hò sông) in free time; 16-string zither (đàn tranh) harmonics glint like lantern light; a soft modern pad and faint water textures underneath. G major pentatonic, sparse. Completely beatless and in free time: no pulse, no metre, no drums or percussion keeping time, so a player can drum on top at any speed.

Traditional northern Vietnamese style with a modern cinematic folk production: verses sung by one woman over 16-string zither (đàn tranh); choruses by two women in close quan họ-style harmony with the full ensemble, deep bronze drums and soft strings; a monochord (đàn bầu) solo bridge; a final chorus; an outro that returns to the title melody on bamboo flute (sáo trúc). 84 BPM, D minor pentatonic. Lyrics are still to be written with the author; until then sing on vocables (à ơi, hò). Avoid Chinese or Japanese instrument colour (no guzheng, erhu, pipa, koto, shakuhachi), rock or trap drums, EDM drops and trailer-style braams.
